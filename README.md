# Shiny app to graph Markov Chains conversion attribution vs heuristic attribution models

This is a Shiny app to have an interface that allows you to graph Markov Chains attribution models vs heuristic models.
You can sort by platform, threshold conversion and date range.
It uses GA data based on Views with conversions as an objective that you should have created beforehand.

It takes a few seconds before the graphs are plotted because of the data fetching and the  markov chains computations.
